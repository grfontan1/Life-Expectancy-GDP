# Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across countries and years using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It includes data analysis and visualization to uncover trends, relationships, and growth rates.

## Features
- **Life Expectancy Over Time**: Line plots showing how life expectancy has changed for each country across the years.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Scatter plots and correlation coefficients examining the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
- **Growth Rate Calculations**: Percentage growth rates for both GDP and life expectancy for each country.
- **Highlights**: Identification of countries with the highest and lowest GDP and life expectancy.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Life-Expectancy-GDP.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Results
- **Life Expectancy Trends**: Countries with increasing or stable life expectancy trends were identified.
- **GDP vs Life Expectancy**: A moderate positive correlation was found, suggesting GDP influences life expectancy to some extent.
- **Growth Insights**: Year-over-year growth rates in GDP and life expectancy revealed economic and healthcare trends.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Country with the highest life expectancy: Germany (81.0 years in 2015).
  - Country with the lowest life expectancy: Zimbabwe (44.3 years in 2004).
  - Country with the highest GDP: United States of America ($3.375 trillion in 2015).
  - Country with the lowest GDP: Zimbabwe ($5.8 billion in 2004).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and calculations.
- **Pandas**: To manipulate and analyze the dataset.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating line plots and visualizing trends.
- **Seaborn**: For scatter plots and correlation analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To organize and present the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset `all_data.csv` includes GDP and life expectancy data for multiple countries and years. It is stored in the `data/` folder.
